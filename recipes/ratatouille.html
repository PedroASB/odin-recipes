    <p>This ratatouille recipe is a version of the terrific French vegetable stew made with fresh tomatoes and lots of summer vegetables. It's very versatile side dish and makes a delicious vegetarian main dish, too.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 eggplant, cut into ½-inch cubes</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried parsley</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 zucchini, sliced</li>
        <li>2 large tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 large onion, sliced into rings</li>
        <li>1 green or red bell pepper, sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic until fragrant and golden brown. Add eggplant and </li>parsley; cook and stir until eggplant is tender and soft, about 10 minutes. Season with salt to taste.
        <li>Spread eggplant mixture evenly across the bottom of the prepared casserole dish; sprinkle with a few tablespoons of Parmesan cheese. Spread </li>zucchini in an even layer over top. Lightly salt and sprinkle with a little more cheese. Continue layering in this fashion, with tomatoes, mushrooms, onion, and bell pepper, covering each layer with a sprinkling of salt and cheese.
